# SynchonousReplication
This dataset contains the C++ code, a Wolfram Mathematica notebook, a Jupyter notebook, and output data files required to reproduce all figures and results presented in 

M. Giannakou and B. Waclaw, Resonant noise amplification in a predator-prey model with quasi-discrete generations, arxiv:2301.13290

Please cite this paper when referring to this dataset.

Please read the description below to find more details about specific items in the dataset:
- figures_for_paper.nb - this Mathematica notebook processes raw data files to create all figures from the paper. Run the notebook sequentially; while it may be possible to generate some figures in a random order, most of the use variables defined in previous cells.
- figure_notebook.ipynb - this is a Jupyter version of the Mathematical notebook. To run it, one must first download free Wolfram engine (https://www.wolfram.com/engine/   ) and then follow this guide https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter   to install Wolfram kernel for Jupyter 
- folders "*K=*_tmax_*" contain data outputted by the C++ code simulating the model. The relevant version of the code is included in each folder. The format of these files is two or three columns, the first is time, the next is either the number of organisms N for the single-species model, or N_A, N_B for the two-species model
- folder "P_extinction" contains simulations runs for obtaining the probability and the time to extinction
- folders "time_series_quasi" and "time_series_exp" contain data for calculating the standard deviation of N_A and N_B
- the main folder contains a few other data files generated by the single- or two-species C++ code
